## 1. Introduction

### Overview of the Project

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for formatting text in a simple and readable way, easily converted to HTML. Widely used for documentation on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, this project focuses on a Markdown Documentation Tool that simplifies writing Markdown documents with a user-friendly interface. It offers live preview, Markdown features, and the ability to export documents as HTML or PDF.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React - A component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Meta.
- **Libraries**:
  - **Showdown**: Converts Markdown text into HTML for display in web browsers.
  - **FileSaver.js**: Saves files directly to the user's computer.
  - **html2canvas**: Captures HTML content and turns it into an image.
  - **jsPDF**: Generates PDF files from HTML content.
- **Styling**: CSS - For layout, animations, dark mode, and responsive design.

### Objectives

1. **Develop a Markdown Editor**: A tool that lets users write Markdown syntax and view formatted text instantly.
2. **Real-Time Preview**: Live updates of Markdown input as formatted text using React.
3. **Export Functionality**: Allows users to export Markdown documents in HTML and PDF formats.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean layout with a dark mode for better readability.

### Workplace and Key Operations

Work was conducted in a home office setup with a primary focus on developing and managing the Markdown editor using React, Showdown, FileSaver.js, html2canvas, and jsPDF.

## 2. Development Phases

### Initial Planning

The project initially considered Python Tkinter but transitioned to React for better interactive UI handling and web technology support.

### Development Stages

- **Technology Transition**: Moved from Python Tkinter to React for a more dynamic and feature-rich application.
- **Real-Time Conversion**: Implemented with React hooks, ensuring the Markdown input and preview are synced in real time.
- **User Interface**: Designed with CSS for responsiveness, including a dark mode option.
